# Posterior_Consistency

The code provided in this project was written as a part of a bachelor's thesis on posterior consistency in bayesian statistics. 

The script 'plot_graphics' can plot any graphic included in the thesis (input: numer between 1 and 15). The other modules must be saved in the same folder. 

At the beginning of every module there is a comment about what the code should do and what can be modified to get other results.
